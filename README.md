Eye see what you did there.

#KUDOS:

This project uses WebGazer and was a fork of their demo page -- check them out [here](https://github.com/brownhci/WebGazer)!

Exercises and some pictures are from [EyeCanLearn](eyecanlearn.com), which is a super comprehensive great resource with tons of eye exercises, tips and info. I learned a lot from them!

Disney character pictures are from [4vector.com](4vector.com).

#Running on your laptop
If you'd like to run this app on your laptop, I will give a brief disclaimer that a lot of the CSS was hardcoded as this project was created in <24 hours at a hackathon. It might not look exactly the same as the demo video. I also use CSS keyframes on background images,
which is only supported in Chrome as of the date of this project.

Steps:
1. `cd` into the /www folder
2. Run the command `browser-sync start --server --files "*"`
3. Navigate to localhost:3000
