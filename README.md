Eye see what you did there.

This project uses WebGazer and was a fork of their demo page -- check them out [here](https://github.com/brownhci/WebGazer)!

Exercises are from [EyeCanLearn](eyecanlearn.com), which is a super comprehensive great resource with tons of eye exercises, tips and info. I learned a lot from them!
